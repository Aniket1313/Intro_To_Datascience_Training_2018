## Crop Yields and Weather - State of NY

### Keywords
Weather, Climate, Crop Yields, Principal Crops

### Summary
This dataset requires the combination of two different data sources. The first set being crop yields
which highlights the annual production of crops dating back to the 1990s. The second data set contains
weather data for each state. But we will mostly be focusing our effort on NY. 

### Why pick this topic
This data will help us understand how weather affects crops and show if there is a declining or increasing
trend on crop production in correlation with the climate change. 

Downloading this data set will be a challenge as there are no visible API for both data sources at the
moment and the data is spread out. Some web scraping might make it easier to obtain data from the second
site, but more likely building the entire data set will require a lot of manual copy and pasting.

### How do I get it?
The documentation for the first dataset is [here](https://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1047)
